# Aelar's Emporium of Magical Wares
New store filled with magical items for Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition!

This mod adds a simple NPC with a store to the game in Waukeen's Promenade.
To install, simply download and run the setup-_SAelar.exe file and follow the setup steps.

Once installed, you can find the merchant in Waukeen's Promenade in the building west of Cernd's home and just north-west of the Blacksmith (there should be a red map pin at the location). Aelar provides a vareity of magical wares that are sure to aid you in any adventure you choose to undertake. Some of the items provide simple benefits and bonuses while others provide far more powerful benefits...but they come with a cost/risk.
