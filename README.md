# Aelar's Emporium of Magical Wares
Having travelled a long way from the Northern lands of Faerun, Aelar has now set up shop within Athkatla at Waukeen's Promenade! During the day, he can be found renting out Maheer's store located one level up on the western side. During the night, he will retire to rest before returning the following day to peddle his wares once more! His store contains a vareity of wares that are constantly expanding with new store. At present, you can find an approximate total of thirteen items in his store; a mixture of weapons, armour, accessories and potions!

Below is a brief list of what can be found in Aelar's store:
- A dagger & battle axe pair that are electricity themed.
- A two-handed sword that hits especially hard on deadly strikes.
- A cursed morningstar that will sustain the wielder's lifeforce but comes with a dangerous cost.
- A razor sharp longsword capable at severing heads but requires some of the wielder's life and experience as payment.
- A suit of scale mail armour that provides the wearer with great resistance to physical blows.
- A helmet that will protect the wearer from severe cold.
- A ring that will make the wearer harder to hit.
- A vareity of potions that offer different effects from Stoneskin to Bless.
