Aelar currently has a total of eight items to offer to new and veteran adventurers. Make sure to stop by to see what he has to offer and keep an eye on his stocks; he is always looking to add more wares to his store!

# Known Issues
- The Enumclaw Dagger provides only one charge of Call Lightning upon purchasing but will still provide two charges after resting.
- The map pin that displays on the area map does not display the name of the store presently but is in the correct location.
